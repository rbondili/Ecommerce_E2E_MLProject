# Ecommerce_E2E_MLProject

We analyze the content of the [E-commerce database](https://www.kaggle.com/carrie1/ecommerce-data) that contains purchases made by about 4000 customers over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09).
  
We then try to segment the customers into several categories, and try to classify new customers into those categories. Finally build machine learning models and check the accuracy.
